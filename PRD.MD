## 4. Processing Pipeline  

1. **Live Video Stream** → Browser capture (WebRTC).  
2. **Pose Estimation Model** (MediaPipe / MoveNet) → Keypoints in real time (~30 fps).  
3. **Form Analysis Engine** → Detect rep counts, joint angles, and deviations from trainer’s template.  
4. **Audio Feedback Module** → Generate immediate cues (TTS: text-to-speech).  
5. **LLM Feedback Layer** → After session, synthesize personalized feedback/diagnosis.  
6. **Storage (Supabase)** → Save session metadata, scores, feedback, and trainer templates.

## 5. User Flows  

### User Flow (Live Session)  
1. Log in → Select assigned workout → Start live session.  
2. Camera feed analyzed in real time.  
3. User hears corrective cues: *“Lift your chest,” “Bend deeper,”* etc.  
4. After session → summary with rep count, score, feedback.  

### Trainer Flow  
1. Upload exercise template with instructions and demo video.  
2. Assign workout to user.  
3. Review client’s session data and form reports.  

### Gym/Clinic Flow  
1. Create gym account → onboard trainers + clients.  
2. Monitor adoption and performance analytics.  
3. Integrate API into existing app/rehab program.
